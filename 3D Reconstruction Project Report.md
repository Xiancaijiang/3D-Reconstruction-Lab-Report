**Student Name:** HongJia
**Date:** 2025.7.28

## Abstract

This report presents the implementation and analysis of 3D reconstruction techniques, including fundamental matrix estimation, essential matrix computation, triangulation, epipolar correspondence, and bundle adjustment. Both theoretical proofs and practical implementations are covered, with results validated through visualization and error analysis.

## 1. Introduction

3D reconstruction from multiple 2D images is a fundamental task in computer vision, relying on  geometric relationships between cameras and scene points. This project addresses both  theoretical foundations (e.g., epipolar geometry) and practical implementations (e.g., fundamental  matrix estimation, triangulation) to achieve metric 3D reconstruction .

### 1.1 Task Overview

• Problem statement: 3D reconstruction from 2D image pairs using epipolar geometry
• Key challenges: Correspondence matching, noise handling, metric reconstruction

### 1.2 Assignment Objectives

• Implement fundamental matrix estimation (8-point/7-point algorithms)
• Recover camera geometry and perform 3D triangulation
• Develop optimization techniques (RANSAC, bundle adjustment)
• Visualize 3D structure from temple images

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Fundamental Matrix Properties (Q1.1)

**Statement:**  Proof that F₃₃ = 0 under normalized coordinates

**Geometric interpretation:**For two cameras with principal axes intersecting at a common 3D point, and image coordinates  normalized such that the origin coincides with the principal point, the fundamental matrix F has a  zero element. This arises because the epipolar lines align with the principal axes due to the  symmetric geometry, leading to the vanishing of the cross-term in the fundamental matrix.

### 2.2 Pure Translation Case (Q1.2)

**Statement:** 
Prove that when the second camera undergoes pure translation along the x-axis relative to the first camera, all epipolar lines in both images are parallel to the x-axis.  

**Solution:**  

1. **Camera Motion:**  

	- Pure translation implies *R = I* and *t = (tₓ, 0, 0)^T*.

	- The essential matrix *E* becomes: 
		
		$$
		E = [t]_\times R = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & -t_x \\
		0 & t_x & 0
		\end{bmatrix}
		$$
		

2. **Epipolar Lines:** 
	For a point *x₁ = (u, v, 1)^T* in the first image, the epipolar line in the second image is:  
	$$
	l_2 = E x_1 = (0, -t_x, t_x v)^T
	$$

	The slope of the line *l₂* is *-a/b = 0*, indicating horizontality.  

### 2.3 Inertial Sensors to Essential Matrix (Q1.3)

**Statement:**
Given inertial sensor data (rotation *R₁*, *R₂* and translation *t₁*, *t₂* for two camera poses), compute the relative rotation *R_rel* and translation *t_rel* to derive *E* and *F*.

![image-20250721184732247](./3D Reconstruction Project Report/image-20250721184732247.png)

**Solution:**

1. **Relative Pose:**  
	$$
	R_{rel} = R_2R_1^T, \quad t_{rel} = t_2 - R_2R_1^Tt_1
	$$

2. **Essential Matrix:**  
	$$
	E = [t_rel]× R_rel
	$$

3. **Fundamental Matrix:** 

$$
F = K_2^{-T} E K_1^{-1}
$$



### 2.4 Mirror Reflection Analysis (Q1.4)

**Statement:** 
Prove that the fundamental matrix *F* between a scene and its mirror reflection is antisymmetric (i.e., *F = -F^T*).  

**Solution:**  

1. **Mirror Transformation:** 
	A mirror reflection can be represented as a camera with projection matrix *P₂ = [R | t]*, where *R* is a Householder matrix (involutory, *R = R^T = R^{-1}*) and *t = 0*.  

2. **Fundamental Matrix:** 
	For *P₁ = [I | 0]* and *P₂ = [R | 0]*, the fundamental matrix is:  
	$$
	F = [t]_\times R = 0 \quad \text{(invalid)}
	$$

	Instead, consider the mirror as a plane inducing a homography *H*. The fundamental matrix becomes: 
	$$
	F = [e']_\times H
	$$
	
	where *e'* is the epipole. For a symmetric scene, *F* is antisymmetric.

Prove that when the second camera undergoes pure translation along the x-axis relative to the first camera, all epipolar lines in both images are parallel to the x-axis.  

**Solution:**  
1. **Camera Motion:**  
   - Pure translation implies *R = I* and *t = (tₓ, 0, 0)^T*.  
   - The essential matrix *E* becomes:  
     \[
     E = [t]_\times R = \begin{bmatrix}
     0 & 0 & 0 \\
     0 & 0 & -t_x \\
     0 & t_x & 0
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]

   \]  
   The slope of the line *l₂* is *-a/b = 0*, indicating horizontality.  

**Conclusion:**  
Epipolar lines are parallel to the x-axis due to the zero entries in *E*.
